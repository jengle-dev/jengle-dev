Hello World!
I'm Jennifer (@jengle-dev)
I’m interested in full stack software development and am enrolled and going through a 6 month coding bootcamp through University of Kansas and edX.
- I’m currently learning a little of everything from a bootcamp I'm enrolled in. The course began at the end of November 2022 and will conclude at the end of May 2023.
- I am open to collaborate but I am still learning basics and would not want to represent myself as an expert of any level or language of code. 

The best way to reach me for collaboration is via email j.engle.dev@gmail.com.
Feel free to reach out and connect on LinkedIn linkedin.com/in/jennifer-engle
